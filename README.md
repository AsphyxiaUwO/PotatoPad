This is a 4-key macropod with a 0.91-inch OLED display. It is also my submission for HackPad and the Highway to Undercity hackathon.
I have never worked with circuitry before, so this was a great first-time experience with KiCad. I am sure I learned a lot with this project.
I have used CAD software like Onshape previously, so I attempted to create a more complex case in compensation for the rather boring PCB design. I mount the screws through the bottom and place the heatset inserts on the top so that I do not let the screw stick out.
